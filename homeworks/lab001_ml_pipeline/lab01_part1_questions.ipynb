    "\n",
    "1. False. The decision boundary of k-NN is non-linear. It is determined locally by the distance to training points, resulting in a complex, jagged shape rather than a single straight line (hyperplane). For instance $k=1$, the boundary is composed of piecewise linear segments (forming Voronoi tessellations) that surround the training examples, which is not a linear hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. False. For $k=1$ the training error always = 0. So we need to find some way to reach this trainig error with $k=5$. For instance if the data is well-separated. In that case, the errors are equal ($0=0$). Therefore, the 1-NN error is less than or equal ($\\le$) to 5-NN, but not always lower ($<$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. False. 1-NN is prone to noise and outliers from the training data. This often leads to higher test error compared to 5-NN, which smooths out the decision boundaries. Since 1-NN does not always have lower test error, the statement is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. True. The computational complexity of classifying a test example with a naive k-NN implementation is $O(N \\cdot \\log k) = O(N)$, where $N$ is the size of the training set. The algorithm needs to compare the test sample against all $N$ training samples, so the time increases as the dataset grows.\n",
